This dataset documents all transactions between 2010 and 2011. Our primary objective is to amplify the efficiency of marketing strategies and boost sales through __customer segmentation__. We aim to transform the transactional data into a customer-centric dataset by creating new features that will facilitate the segmentation of customers into distinct groups using the __K-means clustering__ algorithm. This segmentation will allow us to understand the distinct __profiles__ and preferences of different customer groups. Building upon this, we intend to develop a __recommendation system__ that will suggest top-selling products to customers within each segment who haven't purchased those items yet, ultimately enhancing marketing efficacy and fostering increased sales.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px;

Here is a brief overview of each column:\n\n- __`InvoiceNo`__: This is an object data type column that contains the invoice number for each transaction. Each invoice number can represent multiple items purchased in a single transaction.\n   \n    \n- __`StockCode`__: An object data type column representing the product code for each item. \n\n    \n- __`Description`__: This column, also an object data type, contains descriptions of the products. It has some missing values, with 540,455 non-null entries out of 541,909.\n\n    \n- __`Quantity`__: This is an integer column indicating the quantity of products purchased in each transaction.\n   \n\n- __`InvoiceDate`__: A datetime column that records the date and time of each transaction.\n\n    \n- __`UnitPrice`__: A float column representing the unit price of each product.\n\n    \n- __`CustomerID`__: A float column that contains the customer ID for each transaction. This column has a significant number of missing values, with only 406,829 non-null entries out of 541,909.\n\n    \n- __`Country`__: An object column recording the country where each transaction took place.\n\nFrom a preliminary overview, it seems that there are missing values in the `Description` and `CustomerID` columns which need to be addressed. The `InvoiceDate` column is already in datetime format, which will facilitate further time series analysis. We also observe that a single customer can have multiple transactions as inferred from the repeated `CustomerID` in the initial rows.\n\nThe next steps would include deeper data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, potentially erroneous data, and to create new features that can help in achieving the project goals.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"statistics\"></a>\n# <b><span style='color:#fcc36d'>Step 2.2 |</span><span style='color:#ff6200'> Summary Statistics</span></b>\n⬆️ [Tabel of Contents](#contents_tabel)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left\">\n    \nNow, I am going to generate summary statistics to gain initial insights into the data distribution:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Summary statistics for numerical variables\ndf.describe().T","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-13T18:53:15.996938Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-13T18:53:15.997277Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-13T18:53:16.086984Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-13T18:53:15.997246Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-13T18:53:16.085502Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Summary statistics for categorical variables\ndf.describe(include='object').T","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-13T18:53:16.088538Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-13T18:53:16.088885Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-13T18:53:16.871154Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-13T18:53:16.088855Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-13T18:53:16.869957Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left\">\n<h3 align=\"left\"><font color=#ff6200>Inferences:</font></h3>\n\n\n- __`Quantity`__:\n   - The average quantity of products in a transaction is approximately 9.55.\n   - The quantity has a wide range, with a minimum value of -80995 and a maximum value of 80995.

This column is essential for clustering customers and creating a recommendation system. Imputing such a large percentage of missing values might introduce significant bias or noise into the analysis.\n    \n   - Moreover, since the clustering is based on customer behavior and preferences, it's crucial to have accurate data on customer identifiers. Therefore, removing the rows with missing `CustomerID`s seems to be the most reasonable approach to maintain the integrity of the clusters and the analysis.\n\n    \n- __`Description` (0.27% missing values)__\n   - The `Description` column has a minor percentage of missing values.

A higher mean indicates a customer who spends more, potentially showing interest in premium products, whereas a lower mean might indicate a more budget-conscious customer.\n\n    \n- __Monthly_Spending_Std__: This feature indicates the variability in a customer's monthly spending. A higher value signals that the customer's spending fluctuates significantly month-to-month, perhaps indicating sporadic large purchases. In contrast, a lower value suggests more stable, consistent spending habits. Understanding this variability can help in crafting personalized promotions or discounts during periods they are expected to spend more.\n\n    \n- __Spending_Trend__: This reflects the trend in a customer's spending over time, calculated as the slope of the linear trend line fitted to their spending data. A positive value indicates an increasing trend in spending, possibly pointing to growing loyalty or satisfaction. Conversely, a negative trend might signal decreasing interest or satisfaction, highlighting a need for re-engagement strategies. A near-zero value signifies stable spending habits.

Here's why:\n\nPCA is an excellent starting point because it works well in capturing linear relationships in the data, which is particularly relevant given the multicollinearity we identified in our dataset. It allows us to reduce the number of features in our dataset while still retaining a significant amount of the information, thus making our clustering analysis potentially more accurate and interpretable. Moreover, it is computationally efficient, which means it won't significantly increase the processing time.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that we are keeping our options open. After applying PCA, if we find that the first few components do not capture a significant amount of variance, indicating a loss of vital information, we might consider exploring other non-linear methods. These methods can potentially provide a more nuanced approach to dimensionality reduction, capturing complex patterns that PCA might miss, albeit at the cost of increased computational time and complexity.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left\">\n<h3 align=\"left\"><font color=#ff6200>Methodology </font></h3>\n\nI will apply PCA on all the available components and plot the cumulative variance explained by them.

The __elbow point__ represents the k-value where the reduction in inertia achieved by increasing k becomes negligible, indicating the optimal stopping point for the number of clusters.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left\">\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><font color=#ff6200>Utilizing the YellowBrick Library</font></h3>\n\nIn this section, I will employ the __YellowBrick__ library to facilitate the implementation of the __Elbow method__.

A higher score in this metric generally signals better cluster definitions, thus implying that our clustering has managed to find substantial structure in the data.\n\n    \n- The __Davies Bouldin Score__ of 1.37 is a reasonable score, indicating a moderate level of similarity between each cluster and its most similar one. A lower score is generally better as it indicates less similarity between clusters, and thus, our score here suggests a decent separation between the clusters.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the metrics suggest that the clustering is of good quality, with clusters being well-defined and fairly separated. However, there might still be room for further optimization to enhance cluster separation and definition, potentially by trying other clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"profiling\"></a>\n# <p style=\"background-color: #ff6200; font-family:calibri; color:white; font-size:140%; font-family:Verdana; text-align:center; border-radius:15px 50px;\">Step 11 | Cluster Analysis and Profiling</p>\n⬆️ [Tabel of Contents](#contents_tabel)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left\">\n    \nIn this section, I am going to analyze the characteristics of each cluster to understand the distinct behaviors and preferences of different customer segments and also profile each cluster to identify the key traits that define the customers in each cluster.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"radar_chart\"></a>\n# <b><span style='color:#fcc36d'>Step 11.1 |</span><span style='color:#ff6200'> Radar Chart Approach</span></b>\n⬆️ [Tabel of Contents](#contents_tabel)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left\">\n    \nFirst of all, I am going to create radar charts to visualize the centroid values of each cluster across different features.

Leveraging this information, the system will craft personalized recommendations, suggesting __the top three products__ popular within their cluster that they have not yet purchased. This not only facilitates targeted marketing strategies but also enriches the personal shopping experience, potentially boosting sales.
